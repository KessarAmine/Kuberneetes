# Monitoring containers Health with probes
ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/

we have 3 different probes, liveness, startup, readiness probes

# container health
we keep our containers healthy we restart all the unhealthy containers therfore making the kubernetes app robust.
healthy= containers runing as expected, fucntioning correctly, not broken...

# Liveness Probes
automatically checks wahter a cotnainer app is in healthy state. even if the container is still runinng but not as expected Liveness Probes will detect that. it runs on a scheduler. 
we use the key livenessProbe, exec: command/ httpGet: path/port, initialDelaySeconds, periodeSeconds.

# Startup Probes
similar to liveness probes but runs only at container startup then stop when they succceed, mostly used when we have a case of a really long startup time.
StartupProbe, failureThreshold, periodSeconds

# Readiness Probes
used to determine when a container is ready to accept requests, this case is when users send requests after starting (not fully) a container, so this makes sure that the container is FULLY started to recieve requests.
