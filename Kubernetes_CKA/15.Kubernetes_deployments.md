deploy: is aprt of the control plane component node, it is a k8s object
it defines a desiredState for a replicaSet (of pods same pods running same containers with same configurations).
the deployment controlling maintain the desired state, by creating, deleting and replacing pods with new configurations.

# Use cases
scaling up or down by changing the number of deplicas (replicas tag)
rolling updates to deploy a new software version / rollback to previous version (template tag)
...
an example of a basic deploy object yaml file:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
        name: my-deployment
    spec:
        replicas: 3 /*this is what will determin the scal of the deploy*/
        selector: /*all pods set of labels that match this selector are going to be managed by this deploy whatever how they were created*/
            matchLabels:
                app: my-deployment
        template: /*this will be the part for rolling forward the version of software or rolling back, that is basically a pod template*/
            metadata:
                labels:
                    app: my-deployment
            spec:
                containers:
                - name: nginx
                  image: nginx:1.19.1
                  ports:
                   - containerPort: 80

# Scaling Applications with Deployments

Scaling refers to dedicating more (or fewer) resources to an application in order to meet changing needs.
K8s Deployments are very useful in horizontal scaling, which involves changing the number of containers running an application.

Deployment Scaling: 
The Deployment’s replicas setting determines how many replicas are desired in its desired state. If the replicas number is changed, replica Pods will be created or deleted to satisfy the new number.
we  can scale a deployment simply by changing the number of replicas in the YAML descriptor with kubectl apply or kubectl edit.
Or use the special kubectl scale command:
    $ kubectl scale \
        deployment.v1.apps/my-deployment \
        --replicas=5

# Managing Rolling Updates with Deployments

Rolling updates allow us to make changes to a Deployment’s Pods at a controlled rate, gradually replacing old Pods with new Pods. This allows us to update your Pods without incurring downtime.
/*always use record to add the version to the history to rollback in case something is wrong*/
one of the ways to make a rollout we can do kubectl edit deployment and the we change the version of the image under spec/template of the containers of the pod or we do this will directly update it or we can update the yaml file then apply it to have the new version ruunning or :
>kubectl set image deployment/my-deployment nginx=nginx:broken --record /*my container is nginx the new image is nginx:broken --record is mandatory for avoiding issue*/
after this we check if the rollout was a success we run:
>kubectl rollout status deployment.v1.apps/my-deployment
and we should describe one of the pods to be sure...

Rollback : If an update to a deployment causes a problem, you can roll back the deployment to a previous working state:
>kubectl rollout history deployment.v1.apps/my-deployment /*this alone will get back to the last previous version*/ --to-revision=2 /*this will go back the to the recrord number 2 in hitsotry*/
