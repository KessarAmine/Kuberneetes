# Container File Systems 
The container file system is ephemeral. Files on the container’s file system exist only as long as the container exists.
If a container is deleted or re-created in K8s, data stored on the container file system is lost.

# Volumes 
Many applications need a more persistent method of data storage.
Volumes allow you to store data outside the container file system while allowing the container to access the data at runtime.
This can allow data to persist beyond the life of the container.

# Persistent Volumes 
Volumes offer a simple way to provide external storage to containers within the Pod/container spec.
Persistent Volumes are a slightly more advanced form of Volume. They allow you to treat storage as an abstract resource and consume it using your Pods.

# Volume Types
Both Volumes and Persistent Volumes each have a volume type. The volume type determines how the storage is actually handled.
Various volume types support storage methods such as:
    NFS (network file system)
    Cloud storage mechanisms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
    ConfigMaps and Secrets
    A simple directory on the K8s node

# Volumes and volumeMounts 
Regular Volumes can be set up relatively easily within a Pod/container specification.
volumes: In the Pod spec, these specify the storage volumes available to the Pod. They
specify the volume type and other data that determines where and how the data is actually
stored.
volumeMounts: In the container spec, these reference the volumes in the Pod spec and
provide a mountPath (the location on the file system where the container process will access the volume data).
...
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: volume-pod
spec:
 containers:
 - name: busybox
 image: busybox
 volumeMounts:
 - name: my-volume
 mountPath: /output
 volumes:
 - name: my-volume
 hostPath:
 path: /data
...

# Sharing Volumes Between Containers 
You can use volumeMounts to mount the same volume to multiple containers within the same Pod.
This is a powerful way to have multiple containers interact with one another. For example, you could create a secondary sidecar container that processes or transforms output from another container.
...
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: volume-pod
spec:
 containers:
 - name: busybox1
 image: busybox
 volumeMounts:
 - name: my-volume
 mountPath: /output
 - name: busybox2
 image: busybox
 volumeMounts:
 - name: my-volume
 mountPath: /input
 volumes:
 - name: my-volume
 emptyDir: {}
...

# Common Volume Types
There are many volume types, but there are two you may want to be especially aware of.
hostPath: Stores data in a specified directory on the K8s node.
emptyDir: Stores data in a dynamically created location on the node. This directory exists only as long as the Pod exists on the node. The directory and the data are deleted when the Pod is removed.
This volume type is very useful for simply sharing data between containers in the same Pod.

# PersistentVolumes 
PersistentVolumes are K8s objects that allow you to treat storage as an abstract resource to be consumed by Pods, much like K8s treats compute resources such as memory and CPU.
A PersistentVolume uses a set of attributes to describe the underlying storage resource (such as a disk or cloud storage location) which will be used to store data.
...
kind: PersistentVolume
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
 name: my-pv
spec:
 storageClassName: localdisk
 capacity:
 storage: 1Gi
 accessModes:
 - ReadWriteOnce
 hostPath:
 path: /var/output 
...

# Storage Classes 

Storage Classes allow K8s administrators to specify the types of storage services they offer on their platform
...
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
 name: localdisk
provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
...
For example, an administrator could create a StorageClass called slow to describe lowperformance but inexpensive storage resources, and another called fast for highperformance but more costly resources. This would allow users to choose storage resources that fit the needs of their applications.

apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
 name: slow
provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
...
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
 name: fast
provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
...

# allowVolumeExpansion 
The allowVolumeExpansion property of a StorageClass determines whether or not the StorageClass supports the ability to resize volumes after they are created.
If this property is not set to true, attempting to resize a volume that uses this StorageClass will result in an error.
...
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
 name: localdisk
provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
allowVolumeExpansion: true
...

# reclaimPolicies 
A PersistentVolume’s persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy determines how the storage resources can be reused when the PersistentVolume’s associated PersistentVolumeClaims are deleted.
Retain: Keeps all data. This requires an administrator to manually clean up the data and prepare the storage resource for reuse.
Delete: Deletes the underlying storage resource automatically (only works for cloud storage resources).
Recycle: Automatically deletes all data in the underlying storage resource, allowing the PersistentVolume to be reused. 
*Note: recycle is deprecated, we sue dynamic proviosning check the documentation.
...
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
 name: my-pv
spec:
 storageClassName: localdisk
 persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Recycle
 capacity:
   storage: 1Gi
 accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
 hostPath:
   path: /etc/output
...

# PersistentVolumeClaims 
A PersistentVolumeClaim represents a user’s request for storage resources. It defines a set of attributes similar to those of a PersistentVolume (StorageClass, etc.).
When a PersistentVolumeClaim is created, it will look for a PersistentVolume that is able to meet the requested criteria. If it finds one, it will automatically be bound to the PersistentVolume.
...
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
 name: my-pvc
spec:
 storageClassName: localdisk
 accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
 resources:
   requests:
     storage: 100Mi
...
TIPS: 
Binding a PVC to a PV, the Kubernetes administrator can define storage classes and storage resources, and then allow developers to request storage through PVCs without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. This decoupling of storage provisioning from pod deployment provides flexibility and portability for applications running in Kubernetes.
Binding a PVC to a PV can also help the Kubernetes scheduler. By using PVCs and PVs, the scheduler can make more informed decisions about where to place pods based on the availability of the required storage resources. This allows the scheduler to take into account factors such as storage class, access mode, and capacity when determining the best node for a pod to run on. Therefore, using PVCs and PVs can contribute to more efficient and optimized scheduling of pods in a Kubernetes cluster.

# Using a PersistentVolumeClaim in a Pod 
PersistentVolumeClaims can be mounted to a Pod’s containers just like any other volume.
If the PersistentVolumeClaim is bound to a PersistentVolume, the containers will use the underlying PersistentVolume storage
...
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: pv-pod
spec:
 containers:
 - name: busybox
 image: busybox
 volumeMounts:
 - name: pv-storage
 mountPath: /output
 volumes:
 - name: pv-storage
 persistentVolumeClaim:
 claimName: my-pvc
...

# Resizing a PersistentVolumeClaim 
You can expand PersistentVolumeClaims without interrupting applications that are using them.
Simply edit the spec.resources.requests.storage attribute of an existing PersistentVolumeClaim, increasing its value.
However, the StorageClass must support resizing volumes and must have allowVolumeExpansion set to true.
...
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
 name: my-pvc
spec:
 storageClassName: localdisk
 accessModes:
 - ReadWriteOnce
 resources:
 requests:
 storage: 200Mi
...

# Using PersistentVolumes in Kubernetes practice
PersistentVolumes provide a way to treat storage as a dynamic resource in Kubernetes. This lab will allow you to demonstrate your knowledge of PersistentVolumes. You will mount some persistent storage to a container using a PersistentVolume and a PersistentVolumeClaim.

Create a PersistentVolume That Allows Claim Expansion
Create a custom Storage Class by using vi localdisk.yml.

Define the Storage Class by using:
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1 
kind: StorageClass 
metadata: 
  name: localdisk 
provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
allowVolumeExpansion: true
Save and exit the file by hitting the ESC key and using :wq.

Finish creating the Storage Class by using kubectl create -f localdisk.yml.

Create the PersistentVolume by using vi host-pv.yml.

Define the PersistentVolume with a size of 1Gi by using:

kind: PersistentVolume 
apiVersion: v1 
metadata: 
   name: host-pv 
spec: 
   storageClassName: localdisk
   persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Recycle 
   capacity: 
      storage: 1Gi 
   accessModes: 
      - ReadWriteOnce 
   hostPath: 
      path: /var/output
Save and exit the file by hitting the ESC key and using :wq.

Finish creating the PersistentVolume by using kubectl create -f host-pv.yml.

Check the status of the PersistenVolume by using kubectl get pv.

Create a PersistentVolumeClaim
Start creating a PersistentVolumeClaim for the PersistentVolume to bind to by using vi host-pvc.yml.

Define the PersistentVolumeClaim with a size of 100Mi by using:

apiVersion: v1 
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim 
metadata: 
   name: host-pvc 
spec: 
   storageClassName: localdisk 
   accessModes: 
      - ReadWriteOnce 
   resources: 
      requests: 
         storage: 100Mi
Save and exit the file by hitting the ESC key and using :wq.

Finish creating the PersistentVolumeClaim by using kubectl create -f host-pvc.yml.

Check the status of the PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim to verify that they have been bound:

kubectl get pv
kubectl get pvc
Create a Pod That Uses a PersistentVolume for Storage
Create a Pod that uses the PersistentVolumeClaim by using vi pv-pod.yml.

Define the Pod by using:

apiVersion: v1 
kind: Pod 
metadata: 
   name: pv-pod 
spec: 
   containers: 
      - name: busybox 
        image: busybox 
        command: ['sh', '-c', 'while true; do echo Success! > /output/success.txt; sleep 5; done'] 
Mount the PersistentVolume to the /output location by adding the following, which should be level with the containers spec in terms of indentation:

volumes: 
  - name: pv-storage 
    persistentVolumeClaim: 
       claimName: host-pvc
In the containers spec, below the command, set the list of volume mounts by using:

volumeMounts: 
  - name: pv-storage 
    mountPath: /output 
Save and exit the file by hitting the ESC key and using :wq.

Finish creating the Pod by using kubectl create -f pv-pod.yml.

Check that the Pod is up and running by using kubectl get pods.

If you wish, you can log in to the worker node and verify the output data by using cat /var/output/success.txt.
