# Resource Requests
Allows to define an amount of resources (such as CPU or memory) to expect for a container.
It ddoes not affect the limit of the usage (pods can use more or less then the request), this helps only kubernetes scheduler to secheduel pods on certain nodes depanding on the resources requests for the pod's containers.
To define the resources in the yaml file, we use <requests:> under <resources:>:

...
spec:
    ...
    containers:
        ...
        resources:
            requests:
                cpu: "250m" /*250m = 1/4 of cpu cuz on cpu unit(m) is 1/1000 of cpu*/
                memory: "128Mi:
                ...
...

# Resource limits
in the other hand resource limits: limits the pods on the usage that they should not exceed.
the componenets responsible to force the resource limits to the pods is the container runtime (docker, containerd, CRI-O, rkt, frakti). Some of them will terminate the process of the container that tries to exceed the resource limits. we use <limits:> under <resources:>.
