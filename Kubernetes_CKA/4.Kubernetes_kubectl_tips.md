# Imperative commands
ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/object-management/ , https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/quick-reference/
Declaratvie methode:
    Define objects using data structures like json or yaml
vs Imperative methode:
    define objects using kubectlcommands and flags, they could be faster.
depends on the situation, for example creating just a deploy object , instead of creating file and defining the object inside it then create the deploy with kubectl create we could do:
> kubectl create deployment my-deployment --image=nginx
or we can use them to obtain some sample yaml files, Do a dry run to get some sample yaml without creating the object and Save the yaml to a file.
> kubectl create deployment my-deployment --image=nginx --dry-run -o yaml > deployment.y
(* if we are in hurry like in an exam generate a sample like this then modify it like we want)
we can record commands as well, for example if we want to scale a deploy object we do:
> kubectl scale deployment my-deployment --replicas 5 /*we add a flag to the initial command for records*/ --record
this command allowed the cluster to record the command we just run, if we do:
> kubectl describe deployment my-deploument
in annotations section, we find the recorded command on the object
