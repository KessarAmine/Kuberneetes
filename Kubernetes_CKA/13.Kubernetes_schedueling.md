# K8s schedueling
ref: 
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/kube-scheduler/
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/

it is a process of assignign pods to nodes so kublet run them, made by a contro; plane component called scheduler .
things taken in consideration:
1. resources requests vs available node resources.
2. various configuration that affects schedueling using node labels.
we can use different technics to specefy pod configuration

# nodeSelector
it uses node labels to filter suitable nodes for pods to be assigned to.
...
nodeSelector:
    mylabel : myValue /*here it will just be built on nodes that have that label value*/
...

# nodeName
if we know the specefic name of the node on which a specefic pod will be applied on, we bypass schedueling and use nodeName to make an assignation with name.
...
nodeName: k8s-worker1
...

PS: check the documentation where to mention the selectors depanding on the kind of the componenet in the yaml file

# DaemonSet
it is one of the control panel components, run a copy of a pod on each node, if we add a node daemon set will auto create a copy of a pod on the new node
the relationship between Daemonset and the scheduler is :
    if a pod is already scheduled on a pod daemon set wil not create a copy. cuz it respect the scheduling rules.
one of the usecases when we want to create a pods in worker nodes that doesnt have a schedluer to do a certain task.
# Create a DaemonSet Specification YAML File
1. Create a DaemonSet descriptor:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: beebox-cleanup
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: beebox-cleanup
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: beebox-cleanup
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: busybox
        image: busybox:1.27
        command: ['sh', '-c', 'while true; do rm -rf /beebox-temp/*; sleep 60; done']
        volumeMounts:
        - name: beebox-tmp
          mountPath: /beebox-temp
      volumes:
      - name: beebox-tmp
        hostPath:
          path: /etc/beebox/tmp


2. Create the DaemonSet in the cluster:
kubectl apply -f daemonset.yml

Get a list of pods, and verify a DaemonSet pod is running on each worker node:
kubectl get pods -o wide

PS: all future nodes that will be created will have this daemonSet object
