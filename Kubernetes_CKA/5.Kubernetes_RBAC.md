# RBAC in K8s
Control what uses can do and access in the cluster.

we have Role and ClusterRole, are both kubernetes objects that define a set of permissions, Roles is within particukar namespace and a clusterRole is cluster-wide not specefic to single namespace.

we have RoleBinding, ClusterRoleBinding, both of them are kubernetes objects that connect Roles and ClusterRoles to users.

a Role object has:
metadata:
    namespace, name
rules:
    apiGroups:[""], resources:["pods", "pods/log",...], verbs:["get", "watch", "list"...]

a RoleBinding object has:
metadata:
    name, namespace
subjects:
    kind, name, apiGroup[""]
roleRef:
    kind, name, apiGroup
