# Containers inter-communication
containers communicate with each other using shared volumes.

# init containers
containers for init process, runs once in startup of pods.
they can container and use setup sscripts and software needed for the main containers, this helps up reducing the volume of the main containers and more secure.
we can use init containers to cause a pod to wait for another k8s resource, perform sensetive startup in other containers then the main (app) ones, populate data into a shared volume in startup, communicate with another service in startup.

# Using Init Containers in Kubernetes
1. Create a Sample Pod That Uses an Init Container to Delay Startup
vi pod.yml

Add an init container (at the same level as containers in the file) to delay startup until the shipping-svc service is available:

spec:
  ...
  initContainers:
  - name: shipping-svc-check
    image: busybox:1.27
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'until nslookup shipping-svc; do echo waiting for shipping-svc; sleep 2; done']

2. Create the pod:
kubectl create -f pod.yml
3. Check the status of the pod:
kubectl get pods
It should remain in the Init status.

4. Test Your Setup by Creating the Service and Verifying the Pod Starts Up
    Create the service from the shipping-svc.yml file:
kubectl create -f shipping-svc.yml

5. Check the status of your pod again:
kubectl get pods

It should enter the Running status after about a minute.
